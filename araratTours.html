                    <p>Ararat is Turkey's highest mountain with 5137m and is located at the border with Iran and Armenia. Ararat is an impressive snowy volcano. For several years, Ararat closed for trekking and ascents, but at 1998 opened the mountain again. </p>
                    <p>
                        We climb to summit from Dogubeyazit classic south route. From here, we will attempt the climb after placing two high camps. Crampon, self arrest and basic snow walking techniques are essential. Ararat is not a technical peak but cold winds and high altitude make this an excellent choice for climbers interested in making an ascent of this historical peak.
                    </p>
